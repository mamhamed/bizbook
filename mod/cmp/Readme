This plugin will be home of all ChoiceMatch's profile-related developments.

July 30, 2014
First version only differentiates client and biz profile pages over following plugin-defined profile fields.

For client, here are the profile fields that can be set:
-My display name
-Location
-Phone
-Mobile
-Email
-Age
-Gender
-Relationship Status

For biz, here are the profile fields that can be set:
-My display name
-Summary
-Business Category
-Business Sub-Category
-Description
-Location
-Address
-Phone
-Mobile
-Email
-Twitter username
-Website

For each user type, only those profile fields set are shown on profile page.
Currently, the profile fields are all texts. In the future, we might want to change some of them, such as
'Business Category', to drop down.
