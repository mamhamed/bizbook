Features:
1)Two-way friendship
-Friendship is client-to-client
-When a client adds another client as a friend, the other client is notified. If she approves, friendship is established. The other client may deny. In the meantime, the instigator might decide to revoke.
-Dynamic hovering menus supported. For example, when a client is friends with another client, hovering over her avatar, gives the client “Remove friend” option. However, if they are not friends, hovering gives her “Add friend” option.
2)c2b relationship
-Very primitive form of client-to-business relationship.
-Client instigates the relationship. She can revoke it at a later time. The business can drop it at any time.
-Dynamic hovering menus supported. For example, when no c2b relationship exists, hovering over business’ avatar, gives the client “Select as a service provider” option. Else, it gives the client “Revoke as a service provider” option. Furthermore, if there is a c2b relationship, when the business hovers over the client’s avatar, “Drop as a client” appears in the menu.
3)Follow relationship
-Client to client or business relationship
-Client instigates the relationship. She can revoke it at a later time. The target client/business can drop it at any time.
