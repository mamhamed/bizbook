bizbook is a two sided social network that connects professionals to clients. The network is built on top of 
Elgg (open source social network). However, the core of Elgg has been modified to support two type of users 1) 
businesses 2) clients.

Bizbook uses facebook profile of a client to discover his/her interest profile which we refere to as User Interest 
Fingerprint (UIF). UIF is the base to the network recomendation algorithm.
